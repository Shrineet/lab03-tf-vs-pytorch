# lab03-tf-vs-pytorch
This project is part of the Embedded Systems course at TH Deggendorf under Prof. Tobias Schaffer. The objective is to implement, compare, and evaluate a simple neural network model using both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
